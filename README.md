# ABOUT
 
For clarity, the mod's title refers to *obtuse puzzles*, not players!!


**Clues for The Obtuse** adds a handful of new clues and details into the world to try to smooth out puzzles that I've seen and read about often giving players trouble, and that I personally felt could have used a bit more setup.
The clues added aim to be subtle and set up obscure parts of puzzles, not give the puzzle away completely.

This mod was made out of boredom, but also from a silly perfectionist desire to smooth out a few rough spots I noticed in an incredible game.

NOTE: The mod does not currently add ship logs, because I'm tired and procrastinating enough work, and New Horizons is unable to add logs to existing logs
