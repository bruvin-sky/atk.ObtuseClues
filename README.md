**Clues for The Obtuse** adds a handful of new clues and details into the world to try to smooth out puzzles that I've seen and read about often giving players trouble, and that I personally felt could have used a bit more setup.

The clues added aim to be subtle and help set up obscure parts of puzzles, not give the puzzle away completely.

This mod was another one made out of boredom, but also from a silly perfectionist desire to smooth out a few rough edges I wanted to try my hand at improving in an incredible game.

NOTE: The mod's title refers to obtuse *puzzles*, not players!!
NOTE 2: The mod does not currently add ship logs, because I've procrastinated enough real life work, and New Horizons is unable to add or make new children logs to existing logs
