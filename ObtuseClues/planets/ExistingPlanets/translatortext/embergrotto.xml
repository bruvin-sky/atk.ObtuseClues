		POKE: I hurried here as soon as sand began to recede from <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>]]> to visit the <![CDATA[<color=orange>High Energy Lab</color>]]> - but I did not account for the cacti in this dark cavern puncturing my suit!

		POKE: Perhaps I should simply be patient.. It is terrifying, not knowing if there are cacti buried under the sand that may emerge at any time!

		PYE: Oh, Poke.. If you should ever visit <![CDATA[<color=lightblue>Ember Twin</color>]]> again while the sand is receding, try exercising swiftness - the thick layer of sand should allow you to walk over the cacti!

		POKE: My gratitude for your advice, Pye.. But may I suggest exercising practicality instead, and relocating these plants for the well-being of your visitors?
