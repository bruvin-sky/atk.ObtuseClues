			<Page>Whoa <![CDATA[<i>]]>ho<![CDATA[</i>]]>! Never thought I’d see one of these beasties outside of Giant’s Deep! They were awfully useful back there — maybe a jellyfish could be useful here, too?</Page>
			<Page>BLEARGH. This thing tastes terrible! The outside is all rubbery and tough -- maybe that’s because it insulates the jellyfish’s insides from getting zapped by electricity?</Page>
			<Page>Right, I’m going inside of this jellyfish’s interior cavity to see if what’s in there tastes any better.</Page>
			<Page>Gah, this one's tentacles are all tangled up..</Page>
			<Page>At least it's not making electricity anymore! It'd be way harder to get into the frilly tentacles in the middle when they're all tangled together like this.</Page>
