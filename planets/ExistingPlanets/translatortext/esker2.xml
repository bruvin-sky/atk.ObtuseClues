			<Page>Hah, I guess that's true. Welcome to the space program, hatchling!</Page>
			<Page>By the way: Slate radioed me to boast about some feature they added to the new ships to help keep track of places they've been to before.</Page>
			<Page>Apparently you can mark anywhere you've visited before on your map from the ship log? It was a lot of big words like that.</Page>
			<Page>But uh, if you ever feel like it.. <![CDATA[<Pause>]]> Feel free to use that new feature to mark the Lunar Outpost and drop by for a mug of lunar sap wine anytime!</Page>
			<Page>No pressure. Just have a few crates I've been saving to share with a friend. The longer you save them, the better they taste. <![CDATA[<Pause>]]> And they probably taste really good now.</Page>
			<Page>I'd share some with you right now, but uh, we should probably do it another time.</Page>
			<Page>When you're getting your space legs under you, it's a <![CDATA[<i>really</i>]]> bad idea to add lunar wine on top of that equation.</Page>
